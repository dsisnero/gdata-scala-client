= Introduction =

This document is intended to give a thorough view of the design and implementation of the Google Data Scala client library. If you want to know more about how this library works, or contribute to the project, this is the starting point. It assumes the reader is familiar with [http://scala-lang.org Scala], the [http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html Google Data API protocol], [http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php Atom] and the [http://ietfreport.isoc.org/idref/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol/ Atom Publishing Protocol].

_Note: The Scala client library needs a working [http://scala-lang.org Scala] installation newer than 2.7.0-final. That means a [http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/ nightly build], until a bug fix release is issued to deal with [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/632 this bug]._

= Setup =

This section describes the steps to take if you want to start developing the library. It describes how to checkout the sources, build and run the tests. Everything is straight forward, so most readers used to [http://scala-lang.org Scala] development can skip this section and come back if needed.

Before you start, make sure you have installed the following software:

 * An [http://subversion.tigris.org/ svn] client.
 * [http://ant.apache.org ant]
 * A [http://scala-lang.org Scala] distribution greater than 2.7.0.
 * [http://emma.sourceforge.net/ emma] for code coverage (optional).

== Setting up your working copy ==

Follow the instructions on the [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-scala-client/source/checkout project website] to checkout a working copy. Then `cd` into the directory and type
{{{
$ ant build
}}}
Make sure the environment variable `SCALA_HOME` points to your Scala installation.

To build and run the tests, type
{{{
$ ant test
}}}

The build process can be configured by setting the appropriate values in `build.properties`. If you have installed [http://emma.sourceforge.net/ emma], make sure you update the properties file to point to its installation directory:
{{{
emma.dir=/usr/local/soft/emma-2.0.5312/lib
}}}

Now you can get an html report of test coverage:
{{{
$ ant coverage
}}}

= Library Overview =

The Scala client library handles XML serialization, HTTP connection, authentication and query building for Google Data. The library is centered around serializing and deserializing XML, and provides a core set of classes called _Picklers_, on which all the serialization code is based. The object model is decoupled from serialization code, and the library provides classes for Atom and Google Data common elements. Supported services, like !YouTube or Calendar, define new model classes and picklers, using exactly the same approach as the core library. Users that need to extend the library (for a new service, or to accommodate an extension to an existing service) can use the same approach.

The library provides support for making queries and updating data through HTTP. The approach is straight forward, and similar to the road taken by the [http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/ Java client library]. Users connect to Google services through `Service` objects, that provide methods for making queries and updating data on the server. Queries are encoded as specific URLs, and the Query builder provides a natural syntax for expressing complex queries. These are the objects that are most visible to the users of this library.

== Conventions ==

The library goes to great lengths to provide a type-safe layer on top of the underlying XML protocol. Whenever possible, Scala data types are used to represent the underlying data. Here is a high level view of the conventions followed throughout the library:
 * whenever a piece of data is optional, it is represented as an `Option[T]`. *null* values should never be valid values.
 * whenever a default value is specified for an element or attribute, such data is represented as a value of the right type, and the default value is filled in when parsing.
 * all data is mutable. This is in order to support update (although some services are read-only).
 * serialization code is separated from data representation. Picklers (the name for serialization code) are usually found as values in the companion object of data classes.
 * errors in the HTTP transport layer are signaled as exceptions.
 * convenience methods and constructors are provided for the most common cases. For instance, an `EventEntry` has a constructor taking a title and a description as plain strings (although they could be `html` or `xhtml`) and two `DateTime` objects (although an event might have only one or none).
 * names in data classes closely follow the XML data they model. If an [http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/elements.html#gdEventKind event entry] has an element called `eventStatus`, the `EventEntry` class will have a field named the same. This makes it easy to use existing Google documentation.

== Organization ==

Along with the core classes for XML serialization (_picklers_), there are classes that model the various data used by the Google Data protocol (like feeds, contacts, calendar entries, etc) and HTTP connection classes. The library is split in packages along the following lines:
  * `com.google.xml.combinators` The XML serialization core
  * `com.google.gdata.data` Google Data common classes, including the [http://atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php Atom protocol] classes.
    * `kinds` Google [http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/elements.html kinds] classes (common data classes used by several Google services).
    * `media` [http://search.yahoo.com/mrss Media Rss] classes (used by the !YouTube service).
    * `util` various common classes like `DateTime` or `NormalPlayTime`
  * `com.google.gdata.client` Google Data HTTP connection and authentication handling.
  * `com.google.gdata.<servicename>` specific data classes and services for each implemented service, like Calendar or !YouTube.

= XML Pickler Combinators =

The serialization code is built around [http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/fun/picklercombinators.pdf pickler combinators]. A _pickler_ is an object that can serialize and deserialize some type. The library provides implementations for base cases, and _combinators_ for assembling more sophisticated picklers out of simple ones. This should strike a familiar note if you've ever used the [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/index.html combinator parsing] library in the Scala distribution.

Pickler combinators are implemented in `com.google.xml.combinators`. The `Pickler` interface needs just two methods:
{{{
  abstract class Pickler[A] {
    def pickle(v: A, in: XmlOutputStore): XmlOutputStore
    def unpickle(in: XmlInputStore): PicklerResult[A]
  }
}}}
The input and output types are abstractions over the XML representation. The result type of the unpickle method is a `PicklerResult`, which can be either `Success` or `Error`. All errors are issued through `PicklerResult` values, as this allows combinators to decide later if an error should fail the whole pickler, or try another alternative.

== Primitive picklers ==

The library provides picklers for primitive types. It is interesting to note that they do not commit to an attribute or an element content. Combinators will decide that when they wrap one of the basic picklers.
 * `text` This is a pickler for Strings. 
 * `boolVal` This is a pickler for Booleans.
 * `intVal` This is a pickler for Integers.
 * `doubleVal` This is a pickler for Double values.
 * `dateTime` This is a pickler for date/time in RFC 3339 format.

== Combinators ==

Combinators are functions that take as arguments one or more picklers, and return a pickler for a more complex data type. Sometimes they return a pickler for the same data type as their argument, but perform some processing on input, like `attr` and `elem`:
 * `elem(label, p)` Wraps the given pickler in an element with the given `label`. For instance, `elem('id', text)` creates a pickler that pickles (and unpickles) strings into an element 'id': `<id>Test</id>`. Namespaces can be specified as well (see the API documentation).
 * `attr(label, p)` Wraps the given pickler in an attribute with the given `label`.
 * `seq(pa, pb)` The two picklers are applied in sequence. This combinator is usually written as `pa ~ pb`. The `~` operator is a convenience method defined in the `Pickler` interface, so that sequences can be written using an infix operator.
 * `interleaved(p)`. Makes the given combinator accept input sequences in any order. Unknown elements are ignored. This is used heavily throughout the library.
 * `opt(p)` Turns the given pickler into an optional pickler. If `p` fails, `opt(p)` succeeds with a value of `None`.
 * `rep(p)` Repeatedly apply `p`, until it fails. It results into a list of values handled by `p`.
 * `wrap` A combinator used to adapt one type to another. It has a dedicated section later on.
 * other, less common combinators. See the scaladoc.
